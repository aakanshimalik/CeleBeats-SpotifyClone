# 🎧 CeleBeats

🌟 Project Name: "CeleBeats"
 Celebal x Beats - A music app for celebal Technologies in collaboration with spotify.

"Cele" — short for Celebal Technologies

"Beats" — emphasizing the rhythmic, musical core of the app.

Together, CeleBeats represents the idea of celebrating beats from around the world — music that speaks to a location’s culture, people, or trending sounds.

## 🔌 APIs Used
🎶 Audius API
- Audius is a decentralized, artist-first music platform. We leverage its public API to:

- Fetch trending tracks

- Filter songs by genre, popularity, or artist

- Retrieve metadata such as title, artist, album artwork, and streaming URLs

- Audius enables free access to a wide range of independent and trending music — perfect for a geo-aware discovery platform.

🌍 Geo API (e.g., IP Geolocation, OpenCage, or GeoJS)
- To make CeleBeats location-aware, we use a Geo API to:

- Determine the user's current geographic location via IP


This lets users explore music based on where they are or where they want to be — providing a unique cultural layer to their listening experience.
